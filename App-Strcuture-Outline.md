1. Sentence Completion Excercises

    A. Step 1: 
    
            Determine What You Do Not Want - Via Negativa p.22
            "What do I KNOW I do not want?"

                Part 1: Via Negativa -
                Write each sentence stem and then immediately finish the sentence. Do this for each stem 12 times. Do not worry about spelling, grammar, or repeating yourself. Do not self-censor. These are for you and nobody else. Follow your gut.

                    I feel miserable when I… x12
                    I dread… x12
                    I’m good at but don’t particularly enjoy… x12
                    I can’t imagine doing … for the rest of my life. x12
                    I don’t understand why anybody would … x12
                    One thing that doesn’t appeal to me at all is... x12

                * Book Instructions * p.25

                    - Review what you've written
                    - Circle anything that sticks out that you don't want in your life that is part of your current career trajectory.
                    - Make note of any negatives that you dont like or want and that you dont currently have a plan to deal with.


          
    B. Step 2: 
    
            Determine What You Do Want - Via Positiva

                Part 2: Via Positiva -
                Write each sentence stem and then immediately finish the sentence. Do this for each stem 12 times. Do not worry about spelling, grammar, or repeating yourself. Do not self-censor. These are for you and nobody else. Follow your gut.

                    I feel the time pass quickly when I… x12
                    I feel most fulfilled when I… x12
                    I look up to people who... x12
                    One of the things I’ve been interested in for a long time is… x12
                    I don’t want to miss out on… x12
                    Even if it is challenging, I enjoy... x12

                * Book Instructions * p.27 

                    - Review what you've written
                    - Circle anything that you feel most strongly about.
                        - What MUST you experience in your career?
                        - What would you deeply regret not living out, earning, or experiencing?

    C. Step 3:

            Filter and Order your Intutions:

                - Return all Sentence Stems

                    Via Negativa: 72 sentences 6x12.
                    Via Positiva: 72 sentences 6x12.

                        ~ Rank order the sentences.
                        ~ Pick the STRONGEST sentence x6. 

                        ~ if trouble, use greater than less than sentence such as "I feel more miserable when I _____ than when I _____.

    D. Step 4: 

            Set Up Your Ambition Map and Set the Context for Your Goal

                - Use your top 12 senteces to guide your goal setting and make your goal compelling. You will need a 3 column table.

                table example columns:
                [Via Negativa ---- GOAL ------ Via Positva]

                - Take your six via negativa, then via positiva sentences and rank-order them. 

                (for any goal you consider, does it meet your top sentences in what you want to avoid & achieve?)

    E. Step 5:

            Refine Your Career Goals with Definite Optimism

            Is your goal SMART?

            Specific
            Measurable
            Ambitious
            Reasonable
            Time-bound

            if you answered no for any of the questions above, reformulate your goal until it is SMART. This helps make your goal definite and gives you a clear path to work backwards from in the achievment of your goal.

    F.  Part 6: Work Backwards from the Achievement of Your Goal          to Develop Milestones
            
            Once you set a clear goal that meets SMART metrics, work backwards in time from its achievement. 
            
            What has to happen immediately before you achieve the goal? Before that? Before that? 
            
            Keep filling in this process until you get to an immediately-actionable item:

            In order to ___________________________________, first I must__________________________....

            In order to __________________________, first I must__________________________…

            In order to ___________________________________, first I must__________________________....

            In order to __________________________, first I must__________________________…

            In order to ___________________________________, first I must__________________________....

            In order to __________________________, first I must__________________________…

            In order to ___________________________________, first I must__________________________....

            In order to __________________________, first I must__________________________…

            In order to ___________________________________, first I must__________________________....

            In order to __________________________, first I must__________________________…

            In order to ___________________________________, first I must__________________________....

            In order to __________________________, first I must__________________________…

            In order to ___________________________________, first I must__________________________....

            In order to __________________________, first I must__________________________…

            In order to ___________________________________, first I must__________________________....

            In order to __________________________, first I must__________________________…
            
            Once you arrive at an immediately-actionable item, like “I have to call my banker,” or “I have to put together my newest pitch deck,” schedule that item in right now.
